LTFS Data Science FinHack ( ML Hackathon)

Analytics Vidhya ML hackathon competition. 
Runs from 12th April to the 21st April.

The aim of the competition is to predict probability of a borrower defaulting on a vehicle loan in the first EMI (Equated Monthly Instalments). 
Financial institutions incur significant losses due to the default of vehicle loans. This has led to the tightening up of vehicle loan underwriting and increased vehicle loan rejection rates. The need for a better credit risk scoring model is also raised by these institutions. This warrants a study to estimate the determinants of vehicle loan default.
