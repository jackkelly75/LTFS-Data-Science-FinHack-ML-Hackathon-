LTFS Data Science FinHack ( ML Hackathon)

Analytics Vidhya ML hackathon competition. 
Runs from 12th April to the 21st April.

The aim of the competition is to predict probability of a borrower defaulting on a vehicle loan in the first EMI (Equated Monthly Instalments). 
Financial institutions incur significant losses due to the default of vehicle loans. This has led to the tightening up of vehicle loan underwriting and increased vehicle loan rejection rates. The need for a better credit risk scoring model is also raised by these institutions. This warrants a study to estimate the determinants of vehicle loan default.
Info provided includes:
* Loanee Information (Demographic data like age, income, Identity proof etc.)
* Loan Information (Disbursal details, amount, EMI, loan to value ratio etc.)
* Bureau data & history (Bureau score, number of active accounts, the status of other loans, credit history etc.)

R script "1. Prepare the data" sorts the data so it can be analysed. Useless features (eg. ID number) are removed so they do not effect the prediction model. All catagorical variables are numeric.
